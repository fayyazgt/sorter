A PHP tool to read a translation file, sort it alphabetically based on keys while preserving comments, and create a new sorted translation file.

To use this tool, upload both files on the server root and access it in a web browser like **https://example.com/TranslationSorter.php**.

If you need to, please replace **$originalFilePath** with the actual path to your **orig-translation.properties** file and **$sortedFilePath** with the desired path and name for the newly created sorted translation file.

The tool will read the original translation file, sort the translations, and create a new sorted file while preserving comments.
